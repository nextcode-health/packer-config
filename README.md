NextCODE Packer Config Files
============================

We use Packer (http://www.packer.io/) to create images for our platform.

Instructions
------------

1. Begin by installing Packer (see instructions on website)
2. Clone this repository
3. Select the image that you want to build and change into the corresponding sub-directory of this repository
4. Run `packer build template.json`

It's that simple :-)
